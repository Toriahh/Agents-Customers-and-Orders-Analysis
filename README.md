First SQL Exercise - Retail Database This project is my first exercise using SQL, where I practiced creating and managing a simple relational database.

Project Overview The database consists of three main tables:

Agents: Information about sales agents. Customers: Details of customers. Orders: Records of orders placed.

What I Learned How to create tables and define relationships between them. Inserting and managing data in a database. Writing basic SQL queries to retrieve useful information.

How to Use Run the SQL script in any SQL database management tool. Explore the tables and try running some queries!

This project is the foundation of my SQL learning journey!
